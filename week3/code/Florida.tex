    \section{Interpretation}
        The results of the permutation analysis suggests that the null hypothesis (there is no correlation between temperature and years in Key West) must be rejected, as the p-value is less than 0.05. Additionally, since there were no values where the correlation exceeded 0.5, the p-value can be calculated by measuring a one-sided or 2-sided p-value by adding one to the numerator and dividing by sample size, returning a value of \[ 1.99996e-05 \]
